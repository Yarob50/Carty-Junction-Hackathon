**:star2: :three: Carty App was part of Junction Hackathon That took place in King Abullah University Of Science And Technology. Thankfully, the project was selected to be the third place winner in the hackathon :trophy:** 

The objective of our project was to help stores visitors to get all the goods and items they are looking for as fast as possible by selecting the shortest path in the market to cross over all the needed items and directing the customer using the AR technology as shown in the demo.
